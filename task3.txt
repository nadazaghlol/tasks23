DevOps is the next evolution of agile methodologies.
A cultural shift that brings development and operations teams together.
DevOps is a practice that involves a cultural change, new management principles, and technology tools that help to implement best practices.
When it comes to a DevOps toolchain, organizations should look for tools that improve collaboration, reduce context-switching, introduce automation, and leverage observability and monitoring to ship better software, faster. 

There are two primary approaches to a DevOps toolchain: an all-in-one or open toolchain. An all-in-one DevOps solution provides a complete solution that usually doesn’t integrate with other third-party tools. An open toolchain can be customized for a team’s needs with different tools. Atlassian believes an open toolchain is the best approach since it can be customized with best-of-breed tools to the unique needs of an organization. Using this approach often leads to increased time efficiency and reduces time to market.
